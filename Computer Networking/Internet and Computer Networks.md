In this blog post, I will demonstrate the internet, internet history and computer network.
# What is Computer Network?
Computers connected to each other with cable or wireless radio make up a computer network.
There are two main purposes of computer networks: Communication using computers and sharing of resources. An “internet” allows doing these two things across different computer networks.
# The Internet
The Internet is essentially a network of computer networks.

So your personal computer is connected to other computers at your house or workplace to create a small computer network, which is in turn connected to other computer networks. And so the global Internet encompasses a complex web of interconnected computer networks.
# History of the Internet
In 1950 when the U.S. was in a cold war with the soviet union. Soviets launched sputnik a satellite in space, in response U.S. government created ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) which was mandated with the responsibility of the technological and scientific advancement of the country.

In 1969 ARPANET was created to communicate between computers but the problem was there was no standard protocol for communication then TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) was invented to solve this problem.

In 1980 ARPANET was migrated to TCP/IP.
# World Wide Web
In 1990 Tim Berners-Lee introduced his World Wide Web project to store and retrieve inter-connected documents.
Later, educational, commercial and so many other applications were realized.
The World Wide Web got even more popular with the advent of browsers such as Mosaic and Netscape which allowed combining graphics with web navigation!
